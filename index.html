              <p>
                The Aniva Lighthouse is the most famous Lighthouse in Sakhalin.
                This abandoned lighthouse is difficult to reach: it is situated
                on a small rock called Sivuchya near the rocky Cape Aniva. You
                can only get here by water. The tides are strong here, but the
                breathtaking scenery makes the journey worth while.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lighthouse became Sakhalin's most complex technical
                construction and one of the most interesting lighthouses of its
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Miura Shinobu, and engineer and graduate of the Kanagawa
                Institute of Technology, was the creator of the lighthouse
                project. A legend had it that when the Japanese constructors
                finished the project, a scaled-down copy of the lighthouse was
                presented to the Japanese emperor.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is one of the most inaccessible lighthouse in Russia, and
                lies in an area very difficult to navigate: sea mists are
                frequent here, and sea tides are known to wash ships ashore or
                push them towards underwater rocks. There were many shipwrecks
                in these waters, before the Karafuto Prefecture authorities
                (Sakhalin was Japanese at the time) decided to build a
                lighthouse here in the 1930s.
              </p>
              <p>
                After around 50 years of sharing the island, the Russians
                annexed it all in the Second World War, causing some half a
                million Japanese to be evacuated back to Hokkaido. In 1951 the
                Treaty of San Francisco was signed, officially handing tenure of
                the island over to the Russians, though plenty of territorial
                issues remain over surrounding, smaller islands.
              </p>
              <p>
                construction started in June 1937 and finished in October 1939,
                taking just over two years. Building this navigational structure
                was difficult: all of the construction materials had to be
                delivered by water. Severe weather condition didn't make the
                process any easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                The concrete tower, painted to match the surrounding rocks, was
                erected 31 metres high, with its stroboscopic lamp located 40
                metres above the ground.

          <p>
            Round in shape and equipped with a bay window, the 9-floor tower
            stands on an oval base, which looks like it is coming out of the
            coastal rocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Aniva Lighthouse was well designed for living, even if its
            keepers had to work in extreme weather conditions. The construction
            consists of nine floors of which the first two largest are an annex
            building while the remaining 7 are part of the lighthouse tower. The
            basement was equipped with diesel engines and batteries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ground floor housed kitchen and the food storage, while the
            radio room, equipment room and watch room of the lighthouse were
            situated on the second floor.. The living quarters, which could
            accommodate up to 12 people, were located on the third, fourth and
            fifth floors, each floor having a separate room.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interior of the quarters was modest: two bunk beds and small
            alcoves for personal belongings. Light came in through small
            porthole windows.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sixth floor was where the storeroom used to be. The seventh
            floor housed the mechanism of the pneumatic siren, with horn
            installed directly on the roof of the bay window. The eighth floor
            was used for fuel storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top ninth floor housed the lens rotation mechanism of the
            lighthouse. The lantern rotated inside a bowl with 300 kg of mercury
            that functioned as a bearing.

            The stroboscopic lamp was set in motion by a mechanism similar to a
            clockwork. Running through the centre of a spiral staircase leading
            to the very top of the tower, was a pipe with a suspended weight of
            270 kg inside. It took the weight three hours to reach the bottom,
            rotating the lamp in the process. After that, the lighthouse keeper
            had to rewind the system. The lighthouse had a range of 17.5 miles
            (28.16 km).
          </p>
          <p>
            The elements are slowly destroying the lighthouse. However, it still
            attracts tourists, and the local tourist companies organize trips
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lighthouse was necessary, because the waters in this corner of
            the world were a deadly trap for vessels: underwater currents,
            frequent fog and rocky shoals threatened to destroy ships that
            approached the cape.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1990s, it was decided to make the Aniva Lighthouse autonomous
            by re-equipping it to work from a nuclear power source. The
            radioisotope generators were removed in 2006.
            <i>The lighthouse has been abandoned ever since.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Aniva Lighhoues stands empty, like and old impregnable fortress.
            Seagulls have made their home in its empty rooms.
